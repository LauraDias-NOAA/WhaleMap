# dcs_map
Interactive map of all real-time acoustic whale detections using the WHOI detection and classification system (DCS)

## Overview
I decided to build this app as a visual tool for exploring and gaining intuition about the data we have already collected on baleen whales in the Northwest Atlantic. It is particularly geared towards visualizing seasonal shifts over single and multiple years in an attempt to understand seasonal whale distribution and gaps in our knowledge.

## Demonstration
The live app can be seen here: http://leviathan.ocean.dal.ca/dcs.html
